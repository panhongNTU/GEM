GEM_GxEmodel(snp_file_name, covariate_file_name, methylation_file_name,
  GxEmodel_pv, output_file_name, topKplot = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{snp_file_name}{Text file with rows representing genotype encoded as 1,2,3 or any three distinct values for major allele homozygote (AA), heterozygote (AB) and minor allele homozygote (BB) and columns representing samples, such as the example data file "snp.txt".}

\item{covariate_file_name}{Text file with rows representing covariate factors and the envirnoment value, and the environment value should be put in the last row, and columns representing samples, such as the example data file "gxe.txt".}

\item{methylation_file_name}{Text file with rows representing methylation profiles for CpGs, and columns representing samples,  such as the example data file "methylation.txt".}

\item{GxEmodel_pv}{The pvalue cut off. Associations with significances at GxEmodel_pv level or below are saved to output_file_name, with corresponding estimate of effect size (slope coefficient), test statistics and p-value. Default value is 5.0E-08.}

\item{output_file_name}{The result file with each row presenting a CpG and its association with SNPxEnv, which contains CpGID, SNPID, estimate of effect size (slope coefficient), test statistics, pvalue and FDR at each column.}

\item{topKplot}{The top number of topKplot CpG-SNP-Env triplets will be presented into charts to demonstrate how environment values segregated by SNP groups can explain methylation.}

\description{
GEM_GxEmodel tests the ability of the interaction of gene and environmental factor to predict DNA methylation level.
}
\details{
GEM_GxEmodel explores how the genotype can work in interaction with environment (GxE) to influence specific DNA 
methylation level, by performing matrix based iterative correlation and memory-efficient data analysis 
among methylation, genotyping and environment. 
This has greatly released the computational burden for GxE study from billions of linear
regression (N = number_of_CpGs x number_of_SNPs x number_of_environment) and made it possible to be accomplished in an 
efficient way.
The linear regression is lm (M ~ G x E + covt), where M is a matrix with methylation data, G is a matrix with genotype data,
E is environment data and covt is covariate matrix. E values is combined into covariate file as the last row, and all read from the formatted text data file. The output of
GEM_GxEmodel is a list of CpG-SNP-Env triplets, where the environment factor segregated in genotype group fits to explain
the particular CpG. The significant association suggests the association between methylation and environment can be better
explained by segregation in genotype groups (GxE).
